                File_Management_System
                =============================
    * This is a directory containing project files about file management capabilities of python. THis include opening a text using the open function, counts the number     of characters, and closes the file.
    This is visible in python files file_man-1.py, 1-regular_expression.py, and email.py, files that open mbox-short.txt.


                    intro_to_python
                    ================
    * This is a directory that contains simple introductory file to show how python takes inputs in using the input function, and the use of a print function. And also     it touches on ensuring the input is of desired input, as seen in example_2, which ensures that the input os float.

                    functions
                    ==========
    * This is a directory with files that contain some projects that show how to create a function in python, creating a method, and calling it, as seen in file fnction    -01.py and funtion_02.py

                    Object_Oriented_Programming
                    ===========================
    * This is a directory containing four files, item.py, item.csv, main.py and phone.py
    * This directory touches on object oriented programming basics, ie, creating classes, methods, attributes, inheritance, creating property of a class, and decorators    . It also checks on other "features" such as raising error messages, and creating an empty class too
    * It also touches on importing a csv file, comma separated value file
    * It also touches on importing of modules, as seen in the file phone.py, which imports from class Item, and use of super(). construct after importing.

                    OOP
                    ====
    * This is a directory that contains two directories, JSON, which touches on th working and implementation of json in python, and PYnative_Quizes, which contains different practise tasks regarding python classes


                    unit_tests
                    ===========
    * This is a directory that focuses on the python concept of unit testing before deployment. 
    * This folder uses the python unittest module to test the expected output of the code before production, toensure the code output remains constant during production    and it doesn't break
    *NB, the name of the testfile must start with name, test_.
    *The file test_calculator is a file that tests tests the calculator.py file that is contains function for a calculator
    * The file test_circles.py contains test cases for circle_area, a function that is used to calculate the area of a circle given the radius and raises ValueError and    TypeError.
    * The file test_employees.py contain a unittest for testing  the function in the file employees.py
    NB: in unittest modules, the if __name__ == "__main" is used to declare the name of the current module as main. 
    * The file test_file.py however, doesn't use the unittest rather than doctest
